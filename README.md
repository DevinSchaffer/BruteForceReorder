# BruteForceReorder
Script for the Japanese kanji and vocabulary learning website WaniKani.

Reorders reviews to level as fast as possible.
The ordering does not mix any less important reviews in or randomize the order at all:
1. Currently available unpassed radicals in order of when they became available.
2. Currently available unpassed kanji in order of when they became available.
3. Everything else in order of when it became available.
